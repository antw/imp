module Imp
  ##
  # "Top level" class which defines an Imp application.
  #
  # An Application instance holds all of the configuration and commands for a
  # particular Imp app, rather than defining them in some sort of global
  # variable, allowing multiple Imp applications to co-exist within the same
  # process.
